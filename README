This is a simple rails app thats currently under development that uses Facebook Login api and graph api. 

This app allows the user to login using their faceebook credentials and retrieves their friend list using the grapgh api.

A course registration application is being built over it. 

The app currently has the backend schema in place and I'm currently working on the business logic and the UI.
